PROGRAM 1
Aim:To assign multiple values to multiple variables and display them line by line using Python.

Theory: Python allows multiple assignment in a single statement, making life easier and code prettier.
The print() function with the sep parameter controls how outputs are separated—because formatting matters, even in code.

Algorithm:
1. Assign string values to variables x, y, and z.
2. Use the print() function.
3.Set the separator as a newline to print each value on a new line.

Conclusion: Multiple variable assignment simplifies code and improves readability. Python really said: work smart, not hard.

PROGRAM 2:
Aim: To determine and display the data types of different variables in Python.

Theory: Python is dynamically typed, meaning it figures out data types on its own.
The type() function reveals the data type of any variable—kind of like a personality test, but for data.

Algorithm:
1. Assign integer, float, string, and boolean values to variables.
2.Use type() to identify each variable’s data type.
3.Print the results line by line.

Conclusion: Python efficiently handles multiple data types, and type() helps verify them instantly.
Zero confusion. Maximum clarity.

PROGRAM 3:
Aim: To perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

Theory: Python supports standard arithmetic operators:
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
** Exponentiation
Math in Python is direct and expressive—no drama, just results.

Algorithm:
1.Assign two numeric values to variables.
2.Apply arithmetic operators.
3.Display the results with labels.

Conclusion: Python handles mathematical operations smoothly and accurately, making it ideal for calculations of all scales.

PROGRAM 4:
Aim: To perform and display multiple arithmetic operations using a single print statement.

Theory: The print() function can display multiple expressions at once.
Using sep="\n" improves readability by placing each result on a new line.

Algorithm:
1.Assign values to two variables.
2.Perform arithmetic operations.
3.Print all results using a single print() statement with newline separation.

Conclusion: Combining operations in one print statement reduces code length while keeping output clean and readable.

PROGRAM 5:
Aim: To perform arithmetic operations on user-entered values.

Theory: The input() function accepts data as strings, which must be converted using int() or float() for calculations.
User input makes programs interactive—because static code is kinda boring.

Algorithm:
1.Prompt the user to enter values.
2.Convert inputs to integers.
3.Perform arithmetic operations.
4.Display results neatly.

Conclusion: User input increases program flexibility and interaction. Python ensures smooth conversion and calculation.

PROGRAM 6:
Aim: To calculate the area of a circle using Python.

Theory: The area of a circle is calculated using:
Area = π × r²
The math module provides the constant pi for accurate calculations.

Algorithm:
1. Import the math module.
2. Accept radius input from the user.
3. Apply the area formula.
4.Display the result.

Conclusion: Python’s math module enables precise mathematical computations with minimal effort.

PROGRAM 7:
Aim: To calculate the base-10 logarithm of a number.

Theory: Logarithms are widely used in mathematics and science.
Python’s math.log10() function computes logarithms accurately.

Algorithm:
1.Import the math module.
2.Use math.log10() on a numeric value.
3.Display the result.

Conclusion: Python simplifies complex mathematical functions through its built-in libraries.

PROGRAM 8:
Aim: To compare two numbers and display the result using conditional statements.

Theory: Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on conditions.
The if–else structure helps in decision-making processes.

Algorithm:
1.Assign values to two variables.
2.Compare them using a relational operator.
3.Display the appropriate message based on the condition.

Conclusion: Conditional statements enable logical decision-making, making programs dynamic and intelligent.
